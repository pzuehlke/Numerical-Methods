    "\n",
    "In the context of programming languages, a **procedure** is a collection of instructions to be performed by the computer to accomplish a given task, packaged as a unit. Procedures are also called **functions** and **subroutines**.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìù The name 'procedure' provides a better idea of the concept. The word 'function' may evoke comparison with the usual functions considered in Mathematics (e.g., real functions of a real variable); however, the notion of a procedure is much more general. Unfortunately, in Python the terminology 'function' is the most frequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we may (and will eventually) implement procedures to perform the following tasks:\n",
    "* Take a positive real number (actually, a `float`) and return (an approximation to) its square root.\n",
    "* Take a positive integer as input and decide whether it is prime;\n",
    "* Take a string as argument and reverse it;\n",
    "* Take a matrix having, say, complex entries, and return its inverse (if it exists);\n",
    "* Take a collection of points in the plane and find the line that provides the best fit for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìù In the **functional programming (FP)** paradigm, programs are organized by a sequence of function definitions, and tasks are accomplished by composing them. An important idea in this context is that of an **abstraction barrier**: it is desirable that each function have a single task to perform, and that the user and programmer be able to ignore the actual *implementation* of a function whenever it is called. That is, programs should be organized in such a way that, in order to use a given function, the only relevant information should be what input it requires and what its output will be, but _not_ how this output is obtained.\n",
