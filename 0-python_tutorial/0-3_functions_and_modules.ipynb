    "### 1.1 What is a procedure/function?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of programming languages, a **procedure** is a collection of instructions to be performed by the computer to accomplish a given task, packaged as a unit. Procedures are also called **functions** and **subroutines**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** We may (and will, eventually) implement procedures to perform the following tasks:\n",
    "* Take a positive real number (more precisely, a floating-point number) and return (an approximation to) its square root.\n",
    "* Take a positive integer as input and decide whether it is prime;\n",
    "* Take a string as argument and reverse it;\n",
    "* Take a matrix having, say, complex entries, and return its inverse (if it exists);\n",
    "* Take a collection of points in the plane and find the line that best fits them.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìù The name 'procedure' provides a better idea of the concept. The word 'function' may evoke comparison with the usual functions considered in Mathematics (e.g., real functions of a real variable). However, the notion of a procedure is more general. The difference stems from the fact that a procedure (in Python, but also in most other languages) can rely on and modify objects other than its arguments. Procedures that exhibit this behavior are said to have **side effects**. For example, the most adequate mathematical representation of a procedure that takes no input and returns no output would be the (unique) function from the empty set to the empty set. However, in Python there are _infinitely many_ such procedures, such as one that prints a message or random number to the screen, modifies the value of a global variable, enters an infinite loop, takes input from the user, writes to a file, raises an error, etc.. Each of these functions modifies the state of the program even though they take no input and produce no output. Unfortunately, despite this ambiguity, the terminology 'function' has established itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìù In the **functional programming (FP)** paradigm, programs are organized by a sequence of function definitions, and tasks are accomplished by composing them. An important idea in this context is that of an **abstraction barrier**: Ideally, each function should have a single task to perform and one should be able to ignore its *implementation* whenever it is called. That is, programs should be organized in such a way that, in order to use a given function, the only relevant information should be what input it requires and what its output will be, but not _how_ this output is obtained. In particular, functions having side effects should be avoided, or at least moved to the edges of the program."

The parameters are enclosed by parentheses and separated by commas.\n",
