    "### 1.3 About Python\n",
    "[Python](https://www.python.org/) was originally developed by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) starting in 1989. It is at its core an [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) (_OOP_) language. However, it also supports the main elements of the [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) (_FP_) and [procedural programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) paradigms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to some other widely used languages such as C, Java or Fortran, Python is an _interpreted_ language, meaning that scripts written in Python are not compiled into machine code, but rather run by an _interpreter_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of interpreted languages (over compiled languages) is that they facilitate debugging and testing, since it is unnecessary to compile, link and execute after each modification of the source code. On the other hand, programs written in an interpreted language do not result in stand-alone applications, but rather require the presence of a Python interpreter in the user's computer to be run. Another disadvantage is that programs written in interpreted languages tend to have much slower execution time than their compiled equivalents, sometimes by a factor of 10 or even more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other features of Python that make it suitable for teaching and learning about programming are:\n",
    "* Python is _free_ and _open source_ software (_FOSS_);\n",
    "* Python is available for all major operating systems and very easy to install. Programs written in any given system run without modifications in any other;\n",
    "* Python's syntax is simple and very pleasant, which makes for legible code;\n",
    "* Python has an extensive standard library and vibrant community of users, and its extensions are readily available."

    "### 2.1 Variables and variable types\n",
    "In programming languages, a __variable__ is used to store and manipulate a (not necessarily numerical) __value__. Each of these values must have a __type__, which in turn determines its properties and the operations that can be applied to it. In Python (in contrast to, say, C), variables are __typed dinamically__, meaning that not only can the _value_ of a variable change during a program, but even its _type_ can be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assign a value to a variable, we use the __assignment operator__ `=` in the form _variable name_ `=` _value_.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìù Variable names may include any _alphanumeric characters_ (i.e., the characters A-Z, a-z and 0-9) together with _underscores_ \\_; the initial character must be a letter. By convention we reserve uppercase initial letters to denote _classes_ and lowercase initial letters to name other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìù The type of a variable $ x $ can be inspected through the function `type`(_x_). One can also verify whether variable $ x $ has a given type _variable_type_ through `isinstance`(_x_, _variable_type_).\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è __Important__: In Python, simply creating a variable or assigning a new value to it does _not_ prompt the interpreter to print its value. To _print_ the value of a variable, say $ x $, use `print`(_x_). To force the interpreter to _return_ the value of the variable as output, just type its name, in this case `x`.\n",
