Please [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) the appropriate version for your computer and follow these [installation instructions](https://realpython.com/installing-python/).

    "### 1.3 About Python\n",
    "[Python](https://www.python.org/) was originally developed by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) starting in 1989. It is at its core an [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) (_OOP_) language. However, it also supports the main elements of the [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) (_FP_) and [imperative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) paradigms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to some other widely used languages such as C, Java or Fortran, Python is an _interpreted_ language, meaning that scripts written in Python are not compiled into machine code, but rather run by an _interpreter_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of interpreted languages (over compiled languages) is that they facilitate debugging and testing, since it is unnecessary to compile, link and execute the source code after each modification. On the other hand, programs written in an interpreted language do not result in stand-alone applications, but rather require the presence of a Python interpreter in the user's computer to be run. Another disadvantage is that programs written in interpreted languages tend to have much slower execution time than their compiled equivalents, sometimes by a factor of 10 or even more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other features of Python that make it suitable for teaching and learning about programming are:\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Python is _free_ and _open source_ software (_FOSS_);\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Python is available for all major operating systems, easy to install and its programs are platform-independent;\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Python's syntax is simple and very pleasant, which makes for legible code;\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Python has an extensive standard library and a large community of users and developers;\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Python's abundant extensions are readily available."
